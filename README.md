## üöÄ Modes of Operation & Deployment

This application is designed to be flexible and can be run or deployed in several ways:

1.  **Local Full Mode:** Run the entire application (frontend and Deno-powered backend) on your local machine. Ideal for development, testing, or personal use.
2.  **Deno Deploy (Unified):** Deploy as a self-contained application where the Deno backend serves both the API (under `/api/`) and the frontend GUI.
3.  **Node.js Serverless (Vercel/Netlify):** Deploy the frontend as a static site and the API backend as Node.js serverless functions, suitable for platforms like Vercel and Netlify.

**For detailed instructions on each deployment mode, please see our [Comprehensive Deployment Guide](DEPLOYMENT.MD).**

## üèÅ Getting Started (Local Development)

This section guides you through running the **Local Full Mode**.

### Prerequisites
-   Node.js (v18+ recommended, for `npm` and frontend build tools)
-   Deno CLI (v1.30+ recommended, for the local Deno server)
-   Git

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/lord-dubious/gemini-key-rotator-gui.git # Or your fork
    cd gemini-key-rotator-gui
    ```

2.  **Install frontend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure local environment variables:**
    *   Copy the example `.env` file:
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
    *   Edit the new `.env` file and add your `API_KEYS`. You can also set `GEMINI_API_BASE_URL` and `ACCESS_TOKEN` if needed.
        ```env
        # .env
        API_KEYS=your_api_key_1,your_api_key_2
        # ACCESS_TOKEN=optional_secret_token
        ```

### Running the Local Full Application

1.  **Start the local server and frontend:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev:local
    ```
    This command will:
    *   Build the frontend application.
    *   Start the local Deno server which serves both the frontend and the backend API.

2.  **Open your browser:**
    *   Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or the port specified in `local-server.ts`).

### Frontend-Only Development (Optional)

If you only want to work on the frontend UI components without running the local Deno backend (e.g., if you are pointing to a remote Deno Deploy or Serverless backend via the GUI settings):
```bash
npm run dev
```
Then, open `http://localhost:5173` (or as indicated by Vite). You will need to configure the API endpoint in the GUI's settings page to point to your desired backend.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration in the GUI

The GUI settings (accessible via the gear icon) allow you to:
-   **View and Test API Endpoint:** For unified deployments (Local, Deno Deploy, Vercel/Netlify as configured), the API endpoint typically defaults to `/api` (relative to the GUI's origin) and should work automatically. You can use the settings page to test this connection.
-   **Override API Endpoint:** You can manually set a different API endpoint URL if needed (e.g., to point the locally running GUI to a cloud-deployed backend). This setting is saved in `localStorage`.
-   **Set Access Token:** If your backend is protected by an `ACCESS_TOKEN`, you can enter it here for the GUI to use in its API requests. This is also saved in `localStorage`.

## üìä API Endpoints

When the application is running (locally or deployed), the backend API is accessible under the `/api/` path relative to the GUI's URL. Key endpoints include:

-   **Health Check:** `GET /api/health`
    -   Returns system health, key status (total, active, exhausted).
-   **Statistics:** `GET /api/stats`
    -   Returns detailed usage statistics and recent logs (if logging is implemented in the backend).
-   **Gemini API Proxy:** `POST /api/v1beta2/models/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:generateText` (and other Gemini API paths)
    -   Proxies requests to the configured Google Gemini API, automatically handling key rotation. The path after `/api/` should match the standard Google Gemini API path structure.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Client-Side Security
- **CSP Headers** - Content Security Policy protection (configured in `netlify.toml`, similar for Vercel)
- **XSS Protection** - Cross-site scripting prevention headers
- **Frame Options** - Clickjacking protection headers
- **HTTPS Only** - Enforced by cloud deployment platforms

### API Security
- **Access Token** - Optional API protection via `ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable.
- **CORS Configuration** - Handled by the backend to allow same-origin requests by default.
- **Rate Limiting Logic** - The core backend includes logic to switch keys upon receiving rate limit errors (429) from the Gemini API.
